Septabin Encoding Rules

1. Message Boundaries:
   Each message starts with a START marker (0000000) and ends with an END marker (1111111).

2. No Physical Spaces:
   The encoded binary text contains no physical spaces. SPACE is encoded as its own 7-bit binary value (0111111).

3. Character Set:
   Allowed characters include digits 0-9, uppercase A-Z, lowercase a-z, and punctuation: . ! , ? -

4. Uniform Binary Length:
   Each character is represented by a 7-bit binary code, all of equal length.

5. Case Sensitivity:
   Uppercase and lowercase letters are distinct and have unique codes.

6. Single Start and End Markers:
   Exactly one START and one END marker per message block.

7. Strict 7-Bit Alignment:
   The total length of the encoded binary string is always a multiple of 7 bits.

8. No Extraneous Bits:
   No leading zeros or stray bits outside of START/END boundaries.

9. Message Integrity Check (Checksum):
   A 7-bit checksum is inserted just before the END marker, calculated as:
   - Convert each 7-bit character (excluding START and END) to decimal
   - Sum all values
   - Compute sum modulo 128
   - Convert result to 7-bit binary and insert before END

10. Reserved Values:
    START (0000000) and END (1111111) are reserved markers.

11. Future Expansion:
    Reserve unused 7-bit codes for escape sequences or additional symbols as needed.
